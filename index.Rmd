I'm an evolutionary ecologist with a special interest in how phenology - the timing of seasonal events such as reproduction - affects interactions between plants and their environment. 

I'm currently working as a researcher with prof. Johan Ehrl√©n at Stockholm University, working mainly with two projects: Firstly, we study direct, indirect and correctional selection on leaf-out and flowering phenology. Secondly, we investigate how phenological events are related within and across years, and the role of temperature, resource state and grazing in determining the timing of seasonally occurring events in long-lived plants.  

I got my PhD in Plant Ecology from Stockholm University in 2019, and my MSC in Ecology from that same institution in 2013.
